# Introduction: Why git,docker, automated testing and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company

It can be challenging to maintain and keep track of different versions of code in any given project. The developer team needs a version control systems (VCS) to keep track of various versions developed over time. Such as who developed it, what lines of code were written, and when changes were made.  A significant benefit of a VCS is that if some mistake occurs during coding, developers have an option to roll back. Compare earlier code versions, and fix the errors, which can minimize disruptions occurring to other team members.

# Git

Git is a widely used VCS today, developed as an open-source project in 2005 by the creator of the Linux operating system; with an actively maintained environment. A vast number of developers rely on Git VCS to develop several types of commercial and non-commercial projects.
 
### Advantages of Git
 
* **Performance**

Git is very reliable when compared to other version control systems. New code changes committed, version branches compared and merged, and code optimized for better performance.
 
* **Security**
 
Git is designed to maintain the integrity of source code. File contents, the relationship between file and directories, tags, and commits secured by the SHA1 algorithm.

* **Flexibility**
 
An essential design of Git is the flexible environment to support several kinds of workflows and its efficiency in handling both small and large scale projects.

## Why use Git in your business?
 
Git changes the way how your team will create and deliver work. Various processes, including designing, development, marketing, can be easily handled and maintained using Git in your business.
 
Git has powerful branching capabilities. To start work, developers have first to create a branch. Each branch functions in an isolated environment.
 
Since Git is a distributed VCS, it offers a local repository for each developer with its history of commits. It doesn't require a network connection to create commits, inspect previous file versions, or check differences between two or more commits. With Git, users can add or remove when required. Other team members can continue working using their local repositories and are not dependent upon whether a new branch added or an older one closed.

# Docker 

Docker makes it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers enable a developer to package up an application with parts needed, such as libraries and other dependencies and execute it into one package.

### Benefits:

* Rapid application deployment – containers include the minimal runtime requirements of the application, reducing their size to deploy quickly.

* Version control and component reuse  - Track successive versions of a container, inspect differences, or roll-back to previous versions. Containers reuse components from the other layers, which makes them noticeably lightweight.

* Sharing – Use a remote repository to share your container with others.

# Automated Testing

Every software development team tests its products, yet delivered software almost always has defects. Test engineers strive to catch errors before the product is released. Automated software testing can increase the scope of tests to help improve software quality. Test automation can efficiently execute thousands of different complex test cases during every test run providing coverage that is impossible with manual method. Automated software testing lowers the time to run repetitive tests from days to hours.

# Continuous Integration

Continuous integration is the concept of adding code changes regularly into a shared code repository. The practice encourages committing small changes more often rather than committing infrequent substantial changes.  Each commit prompts a build during which tests are run that help to identify if the changes broke anything.
